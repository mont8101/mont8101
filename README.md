Reflection:
All of the readme's are from projects that are private so I had to copy them over into my public repo. 
All of these projects were from computer architecture and the goal was to learn about how the computer takes input and uses it to create the output we see. 

https://github.com/mont8101/mont8101/tree/main/project1-assembler-team2
our first project was to create an assembler to help us learn how to assemble programs into machine language, and how those machine instructions are executed.

https://github.com/mont8101/mont8101/tree/main/project1-simulator-multiply-team2/simulator
our simulator project was designed to help us understand multicycle CPU designs, how that design executes machine instructions, and how to analyze and compare the performance 
to a single cycle CPU design.

https://github.com/mont8101/mont8101/tree/main/project-3---pipelining-team-2
My favorite of the 5 projects was project 3 where we learned about how the computer handles pipelining and implementing it ourselves. 

https://github.com/mont8101/mont8101/tree/main/project-4---cache-team-2
Our final project was learning about cache design and how a caching processor generates and services address references.
